Personal academic website
=========================

Based on [Freelancer Bootstrap theme](https://startbootstrap.com/theme/freelancer). Completely rewritten to use [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). External dependencies and the contact form were removed. It now uses local fonts and updated local version of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). Fontawesome was replaced by local version of [Bootstrap icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/). Bibliography was added using [Jekyll Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).
