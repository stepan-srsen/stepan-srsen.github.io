Personal academic website
=========================

Based on [Freelancer Bootstrap theme ](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/). Completely rewritten to use Jekyll. External dependencies and the contact form were removed. It now uses local fonts and updated version of Bootstrap. Fontawesome was replaced by local version of Bootstrap icons and Academicons. Bibliography was added using Jekyll Scholar.
